## 

## Overview



his is a small mod that restores the original extended quest for the Rhynn Lanthorn, which was present in the beta version of Baldur's Gate II but was cut before release. Almost all the files are still in the game, so that it can be restored very faithfully.

Note: I don't make any attempt to keep this repo in a playable state, and bug reports based on downloading the repo (and not a released version) are not useful to me.
